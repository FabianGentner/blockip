`blockip` is a RESTful microservice for the management of white- and blacklists of IP ranges,
which I wrote at Zalando, as an open source project.

Please note that the previews of the documentation don't accurately reflect the actual documentation,
which uses Sphinx features that aren't supported by GitHub's reStructuredText renderer. In particular,
the documentation reuses test scenarios as examples for communication with the service, but the preview
shows the `literalinclude` directives that are used to import the scenarios instead.
